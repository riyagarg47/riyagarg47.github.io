                  <p style="color:grey; font-family:sans-serif">I originally belong to Jaipur, Rajasthan. I did my schooling from GR Global Academy and it was here only that my interest started developing towards Web Development. We were taught HTML from 8th standard onwards. I am fond of creating webpages since then. I scored 8.8 CGPA in Secondary and 78.4% in Senior Secondary. 
                  <br><br>
                  I have done graduation in Bachelor's of Technology in Computer Science from Lovely Professional Unviersity, Phagwara Punjab. My CGPA is 8.16. I took my minor as Management Fundamentals where I learnt about basics of subjects like Human Resource Management, Marketing Fundamentals, Financial Management and Financial Accounting.<br>
                  <br>
                  In my spare time, I like sketching and listening to music.
                  I am "always ready to travel" kind of person.
